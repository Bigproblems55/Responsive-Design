            <h1>About Nicholas Lacapria</h1>
            <p>
                I am a full stack webdeveoper. I like to make web apps and have been programming them since 2018. I have specialized in Mern stack development and I am seeking a job in this field. If anyone is looking for someone dedicated enough to development... I am available immediatly and I am willing to relocate if I have to. I work on projects all the time to better myself and I am constantly updating old applications so they adhear to the new standards. I enjoy solving problems and would be greatful to be apart of a team that does what I am learning for fun, to do professionally while making money. I do have a github where you can see my profiles and organizations I have worked with. A major one is Lambda who taught me alot about the field and the way application programming works with react and Nodejs. My githubs are viewable here:
